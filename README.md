# JAVA-Patterns

Hi, I am Dnyanesh. I have created a number of patterns in Java using nested for loops. While creating these patterns, I learned how loops work and how to handle them efficiently. I have implemented 20+ patterns in the Java language.

## Information related to designing patterns in Java:

In Java, pattern printing typically involves using loops to control the structure of the pattern. Here's a brief description of the common elements involved in printing patterns:

1. **Nested Loops:** Patterns often require nested loops - an outer loop for managing the rows and an inner loop for handling the columns or elements within each row.

2. **Row and Column Relationship:** The outer loop controls the number of rows in the pattern, and the inner loop controls the number of elements (characters or symbols) in each row. This relationship is essential for creating various patterns.

3. **Printing Characters or Symbols:** The inner loop is responsible for printing the characters or symbols that form the pattern. These could be asterisks, numbers, or any other characters depending on the desired pattern.

4. **Line Breaks:** Typically, a line break is added after each row to move to the next line. This ensures that the pattern is visually structured and appears as intended.

5. **Pattern Complexity:** The complexity of the pattern depends on how the loops are structured and manipulated. Different patterns can be achieved by altering the loop conditions, using different characters, or combining multiple loops.
